# Experiments

Here we place a variety of tests where we experiment with our dependencies to learn more about how they work. This informs how we integrate and leverage our dependencies in our system.

In general, it is expected that these tests are rather verbose, favoring more direct integrations than heavily abstracted ones, as these tests are primarily meant to be illustrations of the behaviour of different integrations and setups. Obfuscating those integrations with abstractions and custom domain testing languages obscures the lessons learned from each test.

In general, it is expected that each dependency experimentation test will have some comments explaining the test setup and what is demonstrated/learned from each test.
